    "Appeal from the High Court of judicature, Bombay, in a reference under section 66 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1022.\n",
    "K.M. Munshi (N. P. Nathvani, with him), for the appel lant. ' M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (H. J. Umrigar, with him), for the respondent. 1950.\n",
    "May 26.\n",
    "The judgment of the Court was delivered by MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN J.\n",
    "This is an appeal against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in an income tax matter and it raises the question whether munici pal property tax and urban immoveable property tax payable under the relevant Bombay Acts are allowable deductions under section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act.\n",
    "The assessee company is an investment company deriving its income from properties in the city of Bombay.\n",
    "For the assessment year 1940 41 the net income of the assessee under the head \"property\" was computed by the Income tax Officer in the sum of Rs. 6,21,764 after deducting from gross rents certain payments.\n",
    "The company had paid during the relevant year Rs. 1,22,675 as municipal property tax and Rs. 32,760 as urban property tax.\n",
    "Deduction of these two sums was claimed under the provisions of section 9 the Act.\n",
    "Out of the first item a deduction in the sum of Rs. 48,572 was allowed on the ground that this item represented tenants ' burdens paid by the assessee, otherwise the claim was disal lowed.\n",
    "The, appeals of the assessee to the Appellate As sistant Commissioner and to the Income tax Appellate Tribu nal were unsuccessful.\n",
    "The Tribunal, however, agreed to refer two questions of law to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, namely, (1) Whether the municipal taxes paid by the applicant company are an allowable deduction under 555 the provisions of section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act; (2) Whether the urban immoveable property taxes paid by the applicant company are an allowable deduction under section 9 (1) (iv) or under section 9 (1) (v) of the Indian Income tax Act.\n",
    "A supplementary reference was made covering a third question which was not raised before us and it is not there fore necessary to refer to it.\n",
    "The High Court answered all the three questions in the negative and hence this appeal.\n",
    "The question for our determination is whether the munic ipal property tax and urban immoveable property tax can be deducted as an allowance under clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act.\n",
    "The decision of the point depends firstly on the construction of the language employed in sub clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act, and secondly, on a finding as to the true nature and character of the liability of the owner under the relevant Bombay Acts for the payment of these taxes.\n",
    "Section 9 along with the relevant clause runs thus: (1) The tax shall be payable by an assessee under the head ' income from property ' in respect of the bona fide annual value of property consisting of any buildings or lands appurtenant thereto of Which he is the owner, . . subject to the following allowances, namely : (iv) where the property is subject to a mortgage or other capital charge, the amount of any interest on such mortgage or charge; where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the. amount of such charge; where the property is subject to a ground rent, the amount of such ground rent; and, where the property has been acquired, constructed, repaired, renewed or recon structed with borrowed capital, the amount of any interest payable on such capital; . . . \" It will be seen that clause (iv) consists of four sub clauses corresponding to the four deductions allowed 556 under the clause.\n",
    "Before the amending Act of 1939, clause (iv) contained only the first, third and fourth sub clauses.\n",
    "Under the first sub clause interest is deductible whether the amount borrowed on the security of the property was spent on the property or not.\n",
    "There is no question of any capital or other expenditure on the property.\n",
    "The expression \"capital charge\" in the sub clause cannot connote a charge on the capital, that is, the property assessed.\n",
    "That would be a redundancy as the opening words themselves clearly indicate that the charge is on the property.\n",
    "We are therefore of opinion that capital charge here could only mean a charge created for a capital sum, i.e., a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature.\n",
    "In 1933 the Privy Council decided the case of Bijoy Singh.\n",
    "Dudhuria vs Commissioner of Income tax, Calcutta (1 ).\n",
    "It was not an assessment under section 9 but an assess ment on the general income of an assessee who was liable to pay maintenance for his step mother which had been charged on all his assets by a decree of Court.\n",
    "It was not a li ability voluntarily incurred by him but one cast on him by law.\n",
    "The Privy Council held that the amount paid by him in discharge of that liability formed no part of his real income and so should not be included in his assessment.\n",
    "Though the decision proceeded on the principle that the outgoings were not part of the assessee 's income at all, the framers of the amending Act of 1939 wanted, apparently, to extend the principle, so far as the assessment of property was concerned, even to cases where obligatory payments had to be made out of the assessee 's income from the property charged with such payments, and the second sub clause, namely, \"where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the amount of such charge\" was added.\n",
    "It is this sub clause which the appellant invokes in support of its claim to deduction of the municipal and urban, property taxes in the present case.\n",
    "In view of the opening words of the newly added sub clause, the expression \"capital charge\" also used therein cannot have reference to a charge on the property, and we think it must (1) I.L.R. 60 cal.\n",
    "557 be understood in the same sense as in sub clause (1); that is to say, the first sub clause having provided for deduc tion of interest where a capital sum is charged on the property, this sub clause provides for a deduction of annual sums so charged, such sums not being capital sums, the limiting words being intended to exclude cases where capital raised on the security of the property is made repayable in instalments.\n",
    "In Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedbhoy Rowji (1), a Bench of the Bombay High Court considered the meaning of these words.\n",
    "As regards \"annual charge,\" Beau mont C.J. observed as follows : \"The words, I think, would cover a charge to secure an annual liability.\" Kania J., as he then was, said as follows : \"I do not see how a charge can be annual unless it means a charge in respect of a payment to be made annually.\" This construction of the words has been followed in the judgment under appeal.\n",
    "In Gappumal Kanhaiya Lal vs Commissioner of Income tax (2) (the connected appeal before us), the Bench of the Allahabad High Court agreed with the construction placed on these words in the Bombay case, i.e., the words \"annual charge\" mean a charge to secure an annual liability.\n",
    "It is therefore clear that there is no conflict of judicial deci sions as to the meaning of the phrase \"annual charge\" occur ring in section 3 (1) (iv) and the meaning given is the natural meaning of these words.\n",
    "As to the phrase \"capital charge\", Beaumont C.J. in the case above referred to took the view that the words mean a charge on capital.\n",
    "Kania J., however, took a different view and observed that he was not prepared to accept the sugges tion that a document which provides for a certain payment to be made monthly or annually and charged on immoveable property or the estate of an individual becomes a capital charge.\n",
    "In the Allahabad judgment under appeal these (1) I.L.R. (2) I.L.R. 1944 All.\n",
    "558 words were considered as not meaning a charge on capital.\n",
    "It was said that if an annual charge means a charge to secure the discharge of an annual liability, then, capital charge means a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature.\n",
    "We think this construction is a natu ral construction of the section and is right.\n",
    "The determination of the point whether the taxes in dispute fall within the ambit of the phrase \"annual charge not being a capital charge\" depends on the provisions of the statutes under which they are levied.\n",
    "Section 143 of the City of Bombay Municipal Act, 1888, authorises the levy of a general tax on all buildings and lands in the city.\n",
    "The primary responsibility to pay this property tax is on the lessor (vide section 146 of the Act).\n",
    "In order to assess the tax provision has been made for the determination of the annual rateable value of the building in section 154.\n",
    "Section 156 provides for the maintenance of an assessment book in which entries have to be made every official year of all buildings in the city, their rateable value, the names of persons primarily liable for payment of the property tax on such buildings and of the amount for which each building has been assessed.\n",
    "Section 167 lays down that the assess ment book need not be prepared every official year but public notices shall be given in accordance with sections 160 to 162 every year and the provisions o+ the said sec tions and of sections 163 and 167 shall be applicable each year.\n",
    "These sections lay down a procedure for hearing objections and complaints against entries in the assessment book.\n",
    "From these provisions it is clear ' that the liabil ity for the tax is determined at the beginning of each official year and the tax is an annual one.\n",
    "It recurs from year to year.\n",
    "Sections 143to 168 concern themselves with the imposition, liability and assessment of the tax for the year.\n",
    "The amount of the tax for the year and the liability for its payment having been determined, the Act then pre scribes for its collection in the chapter \"The collection of taxes.\n",
    "\" Section 197 provides that each of the property taxes shall be payable in 559 advance in half yearly instalments on each first day of April and each first day of October.\n",
    "The provision as to half yearly instalment necessarily connotes an annual li ability.\n",
    "In other words, it means that the annual liability can be discharged by half yearly payments.\n",
    "Procedure has also been prescribed for recovery of the instalments by presentment of a bill, a notice of demand and then distress, and sale.\n",
    "Finally section 212 provides as follows : \"Property taxes due under this Act in respect of any building or land shall, subject to the prior payment of the land revenue, if any, due to the provincial ,Government thereupon, be a first charge . . upon the said build ing or land . \" It creates a statutory charge on the building.\n",
    "Urban immove able property tax is leviable under section 22 of Part VI of the Bombay Finance Act, 1932,on the annual letting value of the property.\n",
    "The duty to collect the tax is laid on the municipality and it does so in the same manner as in the case of the municipal property tax.\n",
    "Section 24 (2) (b) is in terms similar to section 212 of the Bombay Municipal Act.\n",
    "It makes the land or the building security for the payment of this tax also.\n",
    "For the purposes of section 9 of the Indian Income tax Act both these taxes, namely, the munici pal property tax as well as the urban immoveable property tax are of the same character and stand on the same foot ing.\n",
    "Mr. Munshi, the learned counsel for the appellant con tended that both the taxes are assessed on the annual value of the land or the building and are annual taxes, although it may be that they are collected at intervals of six months for the sake of convenience, that the income tax itself is assessed on an annual basis, that in allowing deductions all payments made or all liabilities incurred during the previ ous year of assessment should be allowed and that the taxes in question fell clearly within the language of section 9 (1) (iv).\n",
    "The learned Attorney General, on the other hand, argued that although the taxes are assessed for the year the liability to pay them arises at the beginning 560 of each half year and unless a notice of demand is issued and a bill presented there is no liability to pay them and that till then no charge under section 212 of the Act could possibly arise and that the liability to pay being half yearly in advance, the charge is not an annual charge.\n",
    "It was also suggested that the taxes were a capital charge in the sense of the property being security for the payment.\n",
    "We are satisfied that the contentions raised by the learned Attorney General are not sound.\n",
    "It is apparent from the whole tenor of the two Bombay Acts that the taxes are in the nature of an annual levy on the property ' and are assessed on the annual value of the property each year.\n",
    "The annual liability can be discharged by half yearly instalments.\n",
    "The liability being an annual one and the property having been subjected to it, the provisions of clause (iv) of sub sec tion (1) of section 9 are immediately attracted.\n",
    "Great emphasis was laid on the word\"due\" used in section 212 of the Municipal Act and it was said that as the taxes do not become due under the Act unless the time for the payment arrives, no charge comes into existence till then and that the charge is not an annual charge.\n",
    "We do not think that this is a correct construction of section 212.\n",
    "The words \"property taxes due under this Act\" mean property taxes for which a person is liable under the Act.\n",
    "Taxes payable during the year have been made a charge on the property.\n",
    "The liability and the charge both co exist and are co exten sive.\n",
    "The provisions of the Act affording facilities for the discharge of the liability do not in any way affect their true nature and character.\n",
    "If the annual liability is not discharged in the manner laid down by section 197, can it be said that the property cannot be sold for recovery of the whole amount due for the year ? The answer to this query can only be in the affirmative, i.e., that the proper ty is liable to sale.\n",
    "In Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedbhoy Rowji(1) Beaumont C.J., while rejecting the claim for the deduction of the taxes, placed reliance on (1) I.L.R. 561 section 9 (1) (v) which allows a deduction in respect of any sums paid on account of land revenue.\n",
    "It was observed that land revenue stands on the same footing as municipal taxes and that as the legislature made a special provision for deduction of sums payable in regard to land revenue but not in respect of sums paid on account of municipal taxes that circumstance indicated that the deduction was not allowable.\n",
    "For the same purpose reference was also made to the provi sions of section 10 which deal with business allowances and wherein deduction of any sum paid on account of land reve nue, local rates or municipal taxes has been allowed.\n",
    "In the concluding part of his judgment the learned Chief Jus tice said that it was not necessary for him to consider what the exact meaning of the words was and that it was suffi cient for him to say that it did not cover municipal taxes which are made a charge on the property under section 212 of the Bombay Municipal Act.\n",
    "Without determining the exact meaning of the words used by the statute it seems to us it was not possible to arrive at the conclusion that the taxes were not within the ambit of the clause.\n",
    "It is elementary that the primary duty of a Court is to give effect to the intention of the legislature as expressed in the words used by it and no outside consideration can be called in aid tO find that intention.\n",
    "Again reference to clause (v) of the section is not very helpful because land revenue is a charge of a paramount nature on all buildings and lands and that being so, a deduction in respect of the amount was mentioned in express terms.\n",
    "Municipal taxes, on the other hand, do not stand on the same footing as land revenue.\n",
    "The law as to them varies from province to province and they may not be necessarily a charge on property in all cases.\n",
    "The legis lature seems to have thought that so far as municipal taxes on property are concerned, if they fall within the ambit of clause (iv), deduction will be claimable in respect of them but not otherwise.\n",
    "The deductions allowed in section 10 under the head \"Income from business\" proceed on a different footing and a construction of section 9 with the aid of section 10 is apt to mislead.\n",
    "562 Kania J. in the above case in arriving at his conclusion was influenced by the consideration that these taxes were of a variable character, i.e., liable to be increased or re duced under the various provisions of the Municipal Act and that the charge was in the nature of a contingent charge.\n",
    "With great respect, it may be pointed out that all charges in a way may be or are of a variable and contingent na ture.\n",
    "If no default is made, no charge is ever enforceable and whenever there is a charge, it can be increased or reduced during the year either by payment or by additional borrowing.\n",
    "In Moss Empires Ltd. vs Inland Revenue Commissioners (1) it was held by the House of Lords that the fact that certain payments were contingent and variable in amount did not affect their character of being annual payments and that the word, \"annual\" must be taken to have the quality of being recurrent or being capable of recurrence.\n",
    "In Cunard 's Trustees vs Inland Revenue Commissioners (2) it was held that the payments were capable of being recur rent and were therefore annual payments within the meaning of schedule D, case III, rule 1 (1), even though they were not necessarily recurrent year by year and the fact that they varied in amount was immaterial.\n",
    "The learned Attorney General in view of these decisions did not support the view expressed by Kania J. Reliance was placed on a decision of the High Court of Madras in Mamad Keyi vs Commissioner of Income tax, Madras(3), in which moneys paid as urban immoveable property tax under the Bombay Finance Act were disallowed as inadmis sible under section 9 (1) (iv) or 9 (1) (v) of the Indian Income tax Act. 'This decision merely followed the view expressed in Commissioner of income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedb hoy Rowji (4)and was not arrived at on any independent or fresh reasoning and is not of much assistance in the deci sion of the case.\n",
    "The Allahabad High Court (1) (2) [1948] 1 A.E.R. 150. (3) I.L.R. (4) I.L.R. 563 in Gappumal Kanhaiya Lal vs Commissioner of Incometax (1) (the connected appeal) took a correct view of this matter and the reasoning given therein has our approval.\n",
    "The result is that this appeal is allowed and the two questions which were referred to the High Court by the Income tax Tribunal and cited above are answered in the affirmative.\n",
    "The appellants will have their costs in the appeal.\n",
    "Appeal allowed.\n",

      "eal No of Appeal by special leave from a judgment of the High Court of Punjab Falshaw and Soni JJ dated upholding the conviction of the appellant under sections and read with section of the Indian Penal Code and confirming the sentence of death passed against him by the Sessions Judge of Ferozepore on the in Criminal Appeal Jai Gopal Sethi R L Kohli with him for the appel lant BK Khanna Advocate General of the Punjab section M Sikri with him for the respondent October The judgment of the court was deliv ered by FAZL ALI J This is an appeal by special leave from the judgment of the High Court of Punjab upholding the convic tion of the appellant Mohinder Singh under sections and read with section of the Indian Penal Code and confirming the sentence of death passed against him by the Sessions Judge of Ferozepore The case for the prosecution which has been substantial ly accepted by the trial Judge and the High Court is briefly as follows Sometime in January one Bachittar Singh brother of Dalip Singh who is said to have been murdered lodged a complaint before the NaibTehsildar at Zira to the effect that a tree belonging to him had been cut by per sons including Mohinder Singh the appellant On the which was the date fixed for the hearing of the case before the Naib TehsiIdar Jita Singh and Dalip Singh the two brothers of Bachittar Singh were attacked by the appellant and one Gurnam Singh a lad of near a Gurdwara at about mid day when they were returning from their field Jita Singh was then carrying a load of fodder on his head while Dalip Singh had sickles in his hand Jita Singh was the first to be at tacked near a tailor s shop by Mohinder Singh who fired at him from behind hitting him on the neck whereupon he fell down together with the bundle of fodder Dalip Singh who was following Jita Singh then ran backwards and he was chased by Gurnam Singh round the outer boundary of a tank which was close by Mohinder Singh ran on the other side of the tank in the opposite direction and confronted him and shot him with a gun on the chest whereupon he fell down Meanwhile Gurnam Singh had also reached the spot and he fired with his rifle from a distance of about or feet near about Dalip Singh s ear while he was lying sideways The injuries proved fatal and Dalip Singh died on the spot The same day at pm Jita Singh went to the police station at Dharamkot which is at a distance of miles from village Augar where the occurrence had taken place and lodged a first information report charging Mohinder Singh with having caused injury to him and Mohinder Singh and Gurnam Singh with the murder of Dalip Singh and the police after investigating the case sent up a charge sheet against the two accused persons Thereafter they were tried by the Sessions Judge of Ferozepore under sections and read with section of the Indian Penal Code The appellant was sentenced to death under section and Gurnam Singh was sentenced to transportation for life under that section in view of his youth They were also sentenced to years rigorous imprisonment each under section read with section of the Indian Penal Code It appears that Dalip Singh had injuries altogether which are described by the doctor who performed the post mortem on his body in these words An irregularly round gun shot wound on the left temporal region diameter The wound is behind outer canthus of left eye its upper portion is at a level with the top of the pinna of the left ear behind it commences at the cartilages of the ear which are broken Brain is visible in the gap of the wound An area x is blackened the wound being situated in the middle of this area A gun shot wound X on the back of right mastoid region upper end of the wound is behind the root of the right ear Direction is vertically oblique On dissection the left temporal bone under injury No is hole and its petrous portion shattered A linear fracture extends upwards and backwards from the hole into the left parietal and occipital bones After piercing through the left temporal lobe of the brain the projectile has pierced through the brainstem and emerged out as injury No holding the mastoid region of the skull on the right side A gun shot wound X on the left side of chest above and behind the left nipple and behind the anterior axillary fold as area below the wound is bruised A gun shot wound X on the right side of chest in the mid axillary line The top of the wound being from the apex of right axilla and above and behind the right nipple A gun shot wound x on the inner aspect of the right arm upper end of the wound is from the top of the anterior axillary fold A gun shot wound X on the front of the right arm Its upper end being from the top of the anterior axillary fold Its distance from injury No being and it is inter connected with injury No under the skin The doctor has stated in his evidence that in all two projectiles appeared to have hit Dalip Singh and injuries Nos and were caused by one of them injury No being the wound of entrance and injury No being the wound of exit With regard to the other injuries his evidence is as follows Injury No is the wound of entrance of another projectile and No is the wound of its exit Wound No is the wound of its re entrance and wound No the wound of its final exit from the body Jita Singh had slight injuries on the back of the neck which are said to have been caused by pellets and two abra sions below the right elbow and right knee said to have been caused by blunt weapons It may be stated here that when the investigating police officer arrived at the scene of occurrence he found an empty cartridge case at the place where Jita Singh is said to have been fired at and empty cartridge cases and a blood stained cap of a cartridge case near the place where the dead body of Dalip Singh was lying Later when Mohinder Singh appeared before the police he was asked whether he possessed a gun and he produced a bore gun exhibit P for which he held a licence The gun and the empty cartridges were thereupon sent to Dr Goyle Director of the CID Laboratory Phillaur and the opinion that he submitted may be summed up as follows The gun had signs of having been fired but he could not say when it was fired last The cartridge cases P and P could have been fired through the gun P but he could not say wheth er they were actually fired from that particular gun or a similar gun or guns He did not make any experiment by firing any cartridge from the gun P nor did he compare the markings on the empty cartridges P and P A notable feature of the case is that the occurrence is said to have taken place in the vicinity of a Gurdwara and some houses but in spite of this fact not a single person of the locality has been cited or examined as a witness by the prosecution The whole case rests on the evidence of witnesses viz Jita Singh Harnam Singh and Buta Singh Jita Singh who had been shot at from behind claims to have seen the two accused firing at his brother Harnam Singh admittedly lives at a considerable distance from the place of occurrence but has stated that he was coming from another village where he had gone to fetch some medicine for his maternal cousin when he saw the occurrence Buta Singh who is a tonga driver belongs to a distant village and is somewhat remotely related to Harnam Singh and accounts for his presence near the scene of occurrence by saying that he had come to see Harnarn Singh the evening before Harnam Singh admitted in his evidence that there was a dispute between him and Mohinder Singh nearly a month before the occurrence about a wall but he also says that the dispute had been amicably settled by the panchayat There is nothing before us to show what the award of the panchayat was and whether or not it left any ill feeling behind But on the argu ments of the counsel and the apparently trivial motive for which Dalip Singh is said to have been murdered it would appear that among the class of persons with which we are concerned petty quarrels give rise to enmity which does not die soon or easily After the close of prosecution evidence in the Ses sions Court the appellant was examined under section of the Criminal Procedure Code and he denied that he had fired at Jita Singh and Dalip Singh with the gun P and that Gurnam Singh had fired at Dalip Singh with a rifle He added that he was not present in village Augur at the time of the alleged occurrence but had gone to Zira to attend the Naib Tehsildar s court To establish his plea of alibi he examined witnesses in the court of the Sessions Judge The first witness was the Naib Tehsildar before whom Bachittar Singh had lodged the complaint and he stated that when the case was called on the or persons appeared in court He also proved an application for a taccavi loan which purports to have been filed by the appel lant on the and bears his thumb impres sion He further stated in his evidence that he had passed orders on that application on the th February but he did not know Mohinder Singh and therefore could not say who had produced that application before him on that date The second witness for the appellant was his brother in law Jogindar Singh who had written the application exhibit D C He has stated that Mohinder Singh himself was present in the court of the Naib Tehsildar on the that he had signed the application exhibit D C and that he was also one of the persons who had appeared before the Tehsildar when Bachittar Singh s case was called out The third defence witness is a hand writing and fingerprint expert He has proved that the application exhibit D C alleged to have been presented to the Naib Tehsildar on the th February bore the thumb impression of the appellant and he has also given evidence to show that certain handwritings which he was asked to compare did not tally The evidence given by him with regard to these handwritings has a bearing on the assertion made by the appellant in a petition filed before the committing Magistrate to the effect that the original service report of the process peon showing that the appellant also was one of the persons served for appearance before the Naib Tehsildar on the had been suppressed and another report with forged handwriting had been substituted in its place Both the courts below have held that the alibi has not been proved by satisfactory evidence and that the charges against the appellant have been made out It seems that the learned Judges of the High Court were not at all impressed by the evidence of Dr Goyle which they characterized as unsatisfactory and they were not also confident that the gun exhibit P had been used in causing the injuries to Dalip Singh This appears from the foliowing observations made by them in their judgment The gun P was identified by Jita Singh as the gun with which Mohinder Singh fired at him and Dalip Singh but he identified the gun because of a brass plate at its butt end We have seen the gun Its brass plate could be of no use for the identification of the gun Again commenting on the nature of the injuries the learned Judges observed as follows Another difficulty which is created in this case is the nature of injuries found on the body of Dalip Singh What kind of bullet it was which though it had blackened the area where it entered the brain showing that it had been fired from not far away did not shatter the brain we do not know What kind of projectile it was which entered the body which if the evidence as to be believed was fired at from a few feet at Dalip Singh and passed through the body without shattering the inside of the chest or causing extensive damage therein is also not known Mr Sethi counsel for the accused quoted Taylor s book on medical jurisprudence and Hateher s book on ballistics and argued that the firing must have been from a place between and yards away in order that the projectile may pass through and through the body and not shatter it That of course pre supposes that the barrel of the gun using the word gun m a generic sense is grooved which causes a projectile to go forward with a rotatory motion of something under a quarter of a million revolutions a minute and travelling at the rate of about miles an hour when it leaves the gun We do not know whether the barrel of this gun exhibit P is grooved or not is a single bar relled gun and is country made The likelihood is that the barrel is not grooved On a careful reading of the judgment under appeal it appears that the learned Judges of the High Court strongly felt that they had no adequate explanation in the oral evidence before them for certain puzzling features of the injuries on Dalip Singh This is exactly what we also feel in this case and it seems to us that the evidence which has been adduced falls short of proof in regard to a very mate rial part of the prosecution case in a case where death is due to injuries or wounds caused by a lethal weapon it has always been considered to be the duty of the prosecution to prove by expert evidence that it was likely or at least possible for the injuries to have been caused with the weapon with which and in the manner in which they are al leged to have been caused It is elementary that where the prosecution has a definite or positive case it must prove the whole of that case In the present case it is doubtful whether the injuries which are attributed to the appellant were caused by a gun or by a rifle Indeed it seems more likely that they were caused by a rifle than by a gun and yet the case for the prosecu tion is that the appellant was armed with a gun and in his examination it was definitely put to him that he was armed with the gun P It is only by the evidence of a duly qualified expert that it could have been ascertained whether the injuries attributed to the appellant were caused by a gun or by a rifle and such evidence alone could settle the controversy as to whether they could possibly have been caused by a fire arm being used at such a close range as is suggested in the evidence It is clear and it is also the prosecution case that only shots were fired at Dalip Singh and one of the crucial points which the prosecution had to prove was that these shots were fired by two persons and not by one man and both the shots were fired in such manner and from such distance as is alleged by the eye witnesses There is in our opinion a gap in the prosecu tion evidence on a most fundamental point and the error which has been committed by the courts below is to ignore the gap and decide the case merely upon the oral evidence of witnesses two of whom are mere chance witnesses and not altogether independent persons and the evidence of the third witness is open to criticism on the ground of his partisanship as well as the improbability of his having been able to see the firing at his brother after he had himself been shot at the back of the neck The learned Judges of the High Court after commenting upon the entire evidence say in their judgment We are thus left with the evidence of the three wit nesses of the prosecution together with the state of wounds as shown by the medical evidence and an unsatisfactory statement of Dr Goyle They reject the evidence of Dr Goyle and they consider the nature of the wounds to have created a serious dificulty in the case Having arrived at these conclusions it was a serious thing to rest the appellant s conviction wholly upon the oral testimony in the case which has remained unchecked and unconfirmed by expert evidence The real position ap pears to be that the prosecution case cannot be said to be wholly proved but only partly proved if it is permissible to use such an expression This Court as was pointed out in Pritam Singh vs The State will not entertain a criminal appeal except in special and exceptional cases where it is manifest that by a disregard of the forms of legal process or by a violation of the principles of natural justice or otherwise substantial and grave injustice has been done It seems to us that the present case comes within the rule laid down because the appellant has been convicted notwithstand ing the fact that the evidence is wanting on a mostmaterial part of the prosecution case This is enough to dispose of this appeal but we are constrained to say that we are not altogether happy about the manner in which the plea of alibi put forward by the appellant has been disposed of by the courts below Ordi narily tiffs court will not look beyond the findings of fact arrived at by the courts below but we find that in the present case the decision on the plea of alibi has been arrived at in disregard of the principle that the standard of proof which is required in regard to that plea must be the same as the standard which is applied to the prosecution evidence and in both cases it should be a reasonable stand ard It is common ground in this appeal that the appellant was summoned to appear before the Naib Tehsildar on the which was the date fixed for dealing with Bachittar Singh s complaint Ordinarily and without looking at anything else there should have been nothing improbable about his appearance before the Naib Tehsildar on that date but in the present case there is positive evidence that an application for a taccavi loan bearing that date and also bearing the thumb impression the appellant was put up before the Naib Tehsildar and that was dealt with by him on that very day There is also affirmative evidence of a witness to prove that the appellant was present in the Naib Tehsildar s court This witness is undoubtedly closely related to the appellant but his evidence is supported by probability and a written document One of the points raised by the prosecution was that the summons for appear ance on the th February was not served upon Mohinder Singh but such evidence as there is on the record bearing on this point has certain peculiar features The prosecu tion having cited the Naib Tehsildar and the Ahlmad Bench Clerk as witnesses in the case gave them up and stated that the former had been won over by the appellant This allega tion could have been substantiated in the cross examina tion of the Naib Tehsildar who was examined as a defence witness but nothing was elicited from him to support such a charge From the evidence of the Naib Tehsildar it appears that on the the Public Prosecutor showed him exhibit PS which is an order directing the appearance of the seven persons including the appellant mentioned by Bachittar Singh in his complaint before the Naib Tehsildar on the and that he told the Public Prosecutor that or persons appeared in his court on that date After this incident on the the Public Prosecutor informed the Court that he would give up the Naib Tehsildar as he has been won over The evidence of the process peon is of a somewhat suspicious character because he has conveniently forgotten every material detail The appellant asserted at the trial that the original report of the process peon had been suppressed and another report had been fabricated and substituted in its place An application to this effect was made by him before the committing Magistrate and he also examined a handwriting expert to prove some of his allegations Neither of the courts below has dealt with the evidence of this expert The evidence of the Investigating Officer as recorded by the Sessions Judge is to the following effect PB and PC were obtained by me from the headquar ters Along with PB and PC the Parvana PS was also received by me After going through the zimnis the witness states that the aforesaid documents PB PC and PS were summoned by the committing Magistrate and were not sent for by the witness On a Foot Constable was certainly sent to Zira to bring the said file But since the file had been sent to the headquarters therefore the said constable returned quite blank I never inspected this file at the headquarters The most material document with which we are concerned is PS which should have contained an endorsement of serv ice of summons on the persons against whom Bachittar Singh had complained It is clear from the first part of the evidence of the Investigating Officer that he had received the report of the process peon which was endorsed on the back of PS from the headquarters but he says later that the papers were sent for but they did not arrive It is surprising that when a document was the subject of so much controversy he should have said by mistake that he had received it One of the comments made by the learned Ses sions Judge in dealing with the application alleged to have been made by the appellant on the for a taccavi loan is that after producing the application before the Naib Tehsildar on that date Mohinder Singh could have reached his village by noon time but on this point the learned Sessions Judge seems to have wholly ignored the evidence of the Naib Tehsildar that he usually dealt with such applications between and PM on working days and also the affirmative evidence of Joginder Singh In our opinion there has been in substance no fair and proper trial in this case and we are constrained to allow this appeal set aside the conviction of the appellant under sections and read with section S of the Indian Penal Code and direct that he be set at liberty forthwith In ordinary circumstances we might have remanded the case for a flesh trial but we consider that such a course would in the present case be unfair and contrary to settled practice seeing that the appellant has been in a state of suspense over his sentence of death for more than a year Appeal allowed\n"

    "Sometime in January, 1949, one Bachittar Singh, brother of Dalip Singh who is said, to have been murdered, lodged a complaint before the NaibTehsildar at Zira to the effect that a tree belonging to him had been cut by 7 per sons including Mohinder Singh, the appellant.\n",
    "On the 28th February, 1949, which was the date fixed for the hearing of the case before the Naib TehsiIdar, Jita Singh and Dalip Singh, the two brothers of Bachittar Singh, were attacked by the appellant and one Gurnam Singh, a lad of 17, near a Gurdwara at about mid day, when 823 they were returning from their field.\n",
    "Jita Singh was then carrying a load of fodder on his head while Dalip Singh had sickles in his hand.\n",
    "Jita Singh was the first to be at tacked near a tailor 's shop by Mohinder Singh who fired at him from behind hitting him on the neck whereupon he fell down together with the bundle of fodder.\n",
    "Dalip Singh, who was following Jita Singh, then ran backwards and he was chased by Gurnam Singh round the outer boundary of a tank which was close by.\n",
    "Mohinder Singh ran on the other side of the tank in the opposite direction and confronted him and shot him with a gun on the chest whereupon he fell down.\n",
    "Meanwhile, Gurnam Singh had also reached the spot and he fired with his rifle from a distance of about 4 or 5 feet near about Dalip Singh 's ear while he was lying sideways.\n",
    "The injuries proved fatal and Dalip Singh died on the spot.\n",
    "The same day at 3 p.m., Jita Singh went to the police station at Dharamkot, which is at a distance of 3 miles from village Augar, where the occurrence had taken place, and lodged a first information report, charging Mohinder Singh, with having caused injury to him, and Mohinder Singh and Gurnam Singh with the murder of Dalip Singh; and the police after investigating the case sent up a charge sheet against the two accused persons.\n",
    "Thereafter they were tried by the Sessions Judge of Ferozepore under sections 302 and 307 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.\n",
    "The appellant was sentenced to death under section 302 and Gurnam Singh was sentenced to transportation for life under that section in view of his youth.\n",
    "They were also sentenced to 3 years ' rigorous imprisonment each under section 307 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.\n",
    "It appears that Dalip Singh had 6 injuries altogether which are described by the doctor who performed the post mortem on his body in these words: \" 1.\n",
    "An irregularly round gun shot wound on the left temporal region, 1\" diameter.\n",
    "The wound is 22\" behind outer canthus of left eye, its upper portion is at a level with the top of the pinna of the left ear, 824 behind it commences at the cartilages of the ear which are broken.\n",
    "Brain is visible in the gap of the wound.\n",
    "An area 4 \" x 4 \" is blackened, the wound being situated in the middle of this area.\n",
    "A gun shot wound 3/4\" X 1/2\" on the back of right mastoid region, upper end of the wound is 1\" behind the root of the right ear.\n",
    "Direction is vertically oblique.\n",
    "On dissection the left temporal bone under injury No. 1 is, hole and its petrous portion shattered.\n",
    "A linear fracture extends upwards and backwards, from the hole into the left parietal and occipital bones.\n",
    "After piercing through the left temporal lobe of the brain the projectile has pierced through the brainstem, and emerged out as injury No. 2, holding the mastoid region of the skull on the right side.\n",
    "A gun shot wound 3/4\" X 5/8\" on the left side of chest 21/2\" above and behind the left nipple and 1/2\" behind the anterior axillary fold as area 1\" below the wound is bruised.\n",
    "A gun shot wound 1/2\"X 3/4\" on the right side of chest in the mid axillary line.\n",
    "The top of the wound being 1 3/4\" from the apex of right axilla and 4 3/4\" above and behind the right nipple.\n",
    "A gun shot wound 1/2\"x 1/4\" on the inner aspect of the right arm, upper end of the wound is 11/4\" from the top of the anterior axillary fold.\n",
    "A gun shot wound 3/4\"X 1/2\" on the front of the right arm.\n",
    "Its upper end being 21/2\" from the top of the anterior axillary fold.\n",
    "Its distance from injury No. 5 being 1\" and it is inter connected with injury No. 5 under the skin.\n",
    "\" The doctor has stated in his evidence that in all two projectiles appeared to have hit Dalip Singh, and injuries Nos. 1 and 2 were caused by one of them, injury No. 1 being the wound of entrance and injury No. 2 being the wound of exit, With regard to the other 4 injuries, his evidence is as follows : \"Injury No. 3 is the wound of entrance of another projectile and No. 4 is the wound of its exit.\n",
    "Wound 825 No. 5 is the wound of its re entrance and wound No. 6 the wound of its final exit from the body.\" Jita Singh had 4 slight injuries on the back of the neck which are said to have been caused by pellets and two abra sions below the right elbow and right knee said to have been caused by blunt weapons.\n",
    "It may be stated here that when the investigating police officer arrived at the scene of occurrence, he found an empty cartridge case at the place where Jita Singh is said to have been fired at, and 2 empty cartridge cases and a blood stained cap of a cartridge case near the place where the dead body of Dalip Singh was lying.\n",
    "Later, when Mohinder Singh appeared before the police, he was asked whether he possessed a gun and he produced a 12 bore gun (exhibit P 16) for which he held a licence.\n",
    "The gun and the empty cartridges were thereupon sent to Dr. Goyle, Director of the C.I.D. Laboratory, Phillaur, and the opinion that he submitted may be summed up as follows : The gun had signs of having been fired but he could not say when it was fired last.\n",
    "The cartridge cases P 10 and P 15 could have been fired through the gun P 16, but he could not say wheth er they were actually fired from that particular gun or a similar gun or guns.\n",
    "He did not make any experiment by firing any cartridge from the gun P 16, nor did he compare the markings on the empty cartridges P 10 and P 15.\n",
    "A notable feature of the case is that the occurrence is said to have taken place in the vicinity of a Gurdwara and some houses, but in spite of this fact, not a single person of the locality has been cited or examined as a witness by the prosecution.\n",
    "The whole case rests on the evidence of 3 witnesses, viz., Jita Singh, Harnam Singh and Buta Singh.\n",
    "Jita Singh, who had been shot at from behind, claims to have seen the two accused firing at his brother.\n",
    "Harnam Singh admittedly lives at a considerable distance from the place of occurrence but has stated that he was coming from another village where he had gone to fetch some medicine for his maternal cousin, when he 826 saw the occurrence.\n",
    "Buta Singh, who is a tonga driver, belongs to a distant village and is somewhat remotely related to Harnam Singh, and accounts for his presence near the scene of occurrence by saying that he had come to see Harnarn Singh the evening before.\n",
    "Harnam Singh admitted in his evidence that there was a dispute between him and Mohinder Singh nearly a month before the occurrence about a wall, but he also says that the dispute ' had been amicably settled by the panchayat\".\n",
    "There is nothing before us to show what the award of the panchayat was and whether or not it left any ill feeling behind.\n",
    "But, on the argu ments of the counsel and the apparently trivial motive for which Dalip Singh is said to have been murdered, it would appear that among the class of persons with which we are concerned petty quarrels give rise to enmity which does not die soon or easily.\n",
    "After the close of prosecution evidence in the Ses sions Court, the appellant was examined under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and he denied that he had fired at Jita Singh and Dalip Singh with the gun P 16 and that Gurnam Singh had fired at Dalip Singh with a rifle.\n",
    "He added that he was not present in village Augur at the time of the alleged occurrence but had gone to Zira to attend the Naib Tehsildar 's court.\n",
    "To establish his plea of alibi, he examined 3 witnesses in the court of the Sessions Judge.\n",
    "The first witness was the Naib Tehsildar before whom Bachittar Singh had lodged the complaint, and he stated that when the case was called on the 28th February, 1949, 6 or 7 persons appeared in court.\n",
    "He also proved an application for a taccavi loan which purports to have been filed by the appel lant on the 28th February, 1949, and bears his thumb impres sion.\n",
    "He further stated in his evidence that he had passed orders on that application on the 28th February but he did not know Mohinder Singh and therefore could not say who had produced that application before him on that date.\n",
    "The second witness for the appellant was his brother in law, Jogindar Singh, who had written the application.\n",
    "exhibit D C.\n",
    "He has stated that 827 Mohinder Singh himself was present in the court of the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949, that he had signed the application (exhibit D C) and that he was also one of the persons who had appeared before the Tehsildar when Bachittar Singh 's case was called out.\n",
    "The third defence witness is a hand writing and fingerprint expert.\n",
    "He has proved that the application (exhibit D C) alleged to have been presented to the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February bore the thumb impression of the appellant, and he has also given evidence to show that certain handwritings which he was asked to compare did not tally.\n",
    "The evidence given by him with regard to these handwritings has a bearing on the assertion made by the appellant in a petition filed before the committing Magistrate to the effect that the original service report of the process peon showing that the appellant also was one of the persons served for appearance before the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949, had been suppressed and another report with forged handwriting had been substituted in its place.\n",
    "Both the courts below have held that the alibi has not been proved by satisfactory evidence and that the charges against the appellant have been made 'out.\n",
    "It seems that the learned Judges of the High Court were not at all impressed by the evidence of Dr. Goyle which they characterized as unsatisfactory and they were not also confident that the gun, exhibit P 16, had been used in causing the injuries to Dalip Singh.\n",
    "This appears from the folio.wing observations made by them in their judgment: \"The gun P 16 was identified by Jita Singh as the gun with which Mohinder Singh fired at him and Dalip Singh but he identified the gun because of a brass plate at its butt end.\n",
    "We have seen the gun.\n",
    "Its brass plate could be of no use for the identification of the gun.\n",
    "\" Again, commenting on the nature of the injuries, the learned Judges observed as follows : 828 \"Another difficulty which is created in this case is the nature of injuries found on the body of Dalip Singh .\n",
    "What kind of bullet it was which, though it had blackened the area where it entered the brain showing that it had been fired from not far away, did not shatter the brain we do not know.\n",
    "What kind of projectile it was which entered the body (which if the evidence as to be believed was fired at from a few feet at Dalip Singh) and passed through the body without shattering the inside of the chest or causing extensive damage therein is also not known.\n",
    "Mr. Sethi (counsel for the accused) quoted Taylor 's book on medical jurisprudence and Hateher 's book on ballistics and argued that the firing must have been from a place between 600 and 1,200 yards away in order that the projectile may pass through and through the body and not shatter it.\n",
    "That of course pre supposes that the barrel of the gun, using the word 'gun ' m ' a generic sense, is grooved which causes a projectile to go forward with a rotatory motion of something under a quarter of a million revolutions a minute and travelling at the rate of about 2,000 miles an hour when it leaves the gun . .\n",
    "We do not know whether the barrel of this gun (exhibit P 16) is grooved or not.\n",
    "is a single bar relled gun and is country made.\n",
    "The likelihood is that the barrel is not grooved.\n",
    "\" On a careful reading of the judgment under appeal, it appears that the learned Judges of the High Court strongly felt that they had no adequate explanation in the oral evidence before them for certain puzzling features of the injuries on Dalip Singh.\n",
    "This is exactly what we also feel in this case, and it seems to us that the evidence which has been adduced falls short of proof in regard to a very mate rial part of the prosecution case.\n",
    "in a case where death is due to injuries or wounds caused by a lethal weapon, it has always been considered to be the duty of the prosecution to prove by expert evidence that it was likely or at least possible for the injuries to have been caused with the weapon with which and in the manner in which they are al leged to have been caused.\n",
    "It is 829 elementary that where the prosecution has a definite or positive case, it must prove the whole of that case.\n",
    "In the present case, it is doubtful whether the injuries which are attributed to the appellant were caused by a gun or by a rifle.\n",
    "Indeed, it seems more likely that they were caused by a rifle than by a gun, and yet the case for the prosecu tion is that the appellant was armed with a gun and, in his examination, it was definitely put to him that he was armed with the gun P 16.\n",
    "It is only by the evidence of a duly qualified expert that it could have been ascertained whether the injuries attributed to the appellant were caused by a gun or by a rifle and such evidence alone could settle the controversy as to whether they could possibly have been caused by a fire arm being used at such a close range as is suggested in the evidence.\n",
    "It is clear, and it is also the prosecution case, that only 2 shots were fired at Dalip Singh and one of the crucial points which the prosecution had to prove was that these shots were fired by two persons and not by one man, and both the shots were fired in such manner and from such distance as is alleged by the eye witnesses.\n",
    "There is, in our opinion, a gap in the prosecu tion evidence on a most fundamental point and the error which has been committed by the courts below is to ignore the gap and decide the case merely upon the oral evidence of 3 witnesses, two of whom are mere chance witnesses and not altogether independent persons, and the evidence of the third witness is open to criticism on the ground of his partisanship as well as the improbability of his having been able to see the firing at his brother after he had himself been shot at the back of the neck.\n",
    "The learned Judges of the High Court, after commenting upon the entire evidence, say in their judgment: \" We are thus left with the evidence of the three wit nesses of the prosecution together with the state of wounds as shown by the medical evidence and an unsatisfactory statement of Dr. Goyle.\n",
    "\" 106 830 They reject the evidence of Dr. Goyle and they consider the nature of the wounds to have created a serious dificulty in the case.\n",
    "Having arrived at these conclusions, it was a serious thing to rest the appellant 's conviction wholly upon the oral testimony in the case which has remained unchecked and unconfirmed by expert evidence.\n",
    "The real position ap pears to be that the prosecution case cannot be said to be wholly proved but only partly proved if it is permissible to use such an expression.\n",
    "This Court, as was pointed out in Pritam Singh vs The State (1), will not entertain a criminal appeal except in special and exceptional cases where it is manifest that by a disregard of the forms of legal process or by a violation of the principles of natural justice or otherwise substantial and grave injustice has been done.\n",
    "It seems to us that the present case comes within the rule laid down, because the appellant has been convicted notwithstand ing the fact that the evidence is wanting on a most.material part of the prosecution case.\n",
    "This is enough to dispose of this appeal, but we are constrained to say that we are not altogether happy about the manner in which the plea of alibi put forward by the appellant has been disposed of by the courts below.\n",
    "Ordi narily tiffs court will not look beyond the findings of fact arrived at by the courts below, but we find that in the present case the decision on the plea of alibi has been arrived at in disregard of the principle that the standard of proof which is required in regard to that plea must be the same as the standard which is applied to the prosecution evidence and in both cases it should be a reasonable stand ard.\n",
    "It is common ground in this appeal that the appellant was summoned to appear before the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949, which was the date fixed for dealing with Bachittar Singh 's complaint.\n",
    "Ordinarily and without looking at anything else, there should have been nothing improbable about his appearance before the Naib Tehsildar on that date, but in the present case there is positive (1) 831 evidence that an application for a taccavi loan bearing that date and also bearing the thumb impression the appellant was put up before the Naib Tehsildar and that was dealt with by him on that very day.\n",
    "There is also affirmative evidence of a witness to prove that the appellant was present in the Naib Tehsildar 's court.\n",
    "This witness is undoubtedly closely related to the appellant but his evidence is supported by probability and a written document.\n",
    "One of the points raised by the prosecution was that the summons for appear ance on the 28th February was not served upon Mohinder Singh, but such evidence as there is on the record bearing on this point has certain peculiar features.\n",
    "The prosecu tion having cited the Naib Tehsildar and the Ahlmad (Bench Clerk) as witnesses in the case gave them up and stated that the former had been won over by the appellant.\n",
    "This allega tion could have been substantiated in the cross examina tion of the Naib Tehsildar who was examined as a defence witness, but nothing was elicited from him to support such a charge.\n",
    "From the evidence of the Naib Tehsildar, it appears that on the 5th July, 1949, the Public Prosecutor showed him exhibit P.S. (which is an order directing the appearance of the seven persons including the appellant mentioned by Bachittar Singh in his complaint, before the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949).\n",
    "and that he told the Public Prosecutor that 6 or 7 persons appeared in his court.\n",
    "on that date.\n",
    "After this incident, on the 6th July, 1949, the Public Prosecutor informed the Court that he would \"give up the Naib Tehsildar as he has been won over \".\n",
    "The evidence of the process peon is of a somewhat suspicious character, because he has conveniently forgotten every material detail.\n",
    "The appellant asserted at the trial that the original report of the process peon had been suppressed and another report had been fabricated and substituted in its place.\n",
    "An application to this effect was made by him before the committing Magistrate, and he also examined a handwriting expert to prove some of his allegations.\n",
    "Neither of the courts below has dealt with the evidence 832 of this expert.\n",
    "The evidence of the Investigating Officer as recorded by the Sessions Judge is to the following effect : \"P.B. and P.C. were obtained by me from the headquar ters.\n",
    "Along with P.B. and P.C. the Parvana P.S. was also received by me.\n",
    "After going through the zimnis, the witness states that the aforesaid documents P.B., P.C. and P.S. were summoned by the committing Magistrate and were not sent for by the witness.\n",
    "On 16th March, 1949, a Foot Constable was certainly sent to Zira to bring the said file.\n",
    "But since the file had been sent to the headquarters, therefore, the said constable returned quite blank.\n",
    "I never inspected this file at the headquarters.\n",
    "\" The most material document with which we are concerned is P.S. which should have contained an endorsement of serv ice of summons on the persons against whom Bachittar Singh had complained.\n",
    "It is clear from the first part of the evidence of the Investigating Officer that he had received the report of the process peon which was endorsed on the back of P.S., from the headquarters, but he says later that the papers were sent for but they did not arrive.\n",
    "It is surprising that when a document was the subject of so much controversy he should have said by mistake that he had received it.\n",
    "One of the comments made by the learned Ses sions Judge in dealing with the application alleged to have been made by the appellant on the 28th February, 1949, for a taccavi loan is that after producing the application before the Naib Tehsildar on that date, Mohinder Singh could have reached his village by noon time, but on this point the learned Sessions Judge seems to have wholly ignored the evidence of the Naib Tehsildar that he usually dealt with such applications between 12 and 4 P.M. on working days, and also the affirmative evidence of Joginder Singh.\n",
    "In our opinion, there has been in substance no fair and proper trial in this case, and we are constrained to allow this appeal, set aside the conviction of the appellant under sections 302 and 307 read with section S4 833 of the Indian Penal Code, and direct that he be set at liberty forthwith.\n",
    "In ordinary circumstances, we might have remanded the case for a flesh trial, but we consider that such a course would, in the present case, be unfair and contrary to settled practice, seeing that the appellant has been in a state of suspense over his sentence of death for more than a year.\n",
    "Appeal allowed.\n",

th February YEAR had been suppressed and another report with forged handwriting had been substituted in its place Both the courts below have held that the alibi has not been proved by satisfactory evidence and that the charges against the appellant have been made out It seems that the learned Judges of the High Court were not at all impressed by the evidence of Dr Goyle which they characterized as unsatisfactory and they were not also confident that the gun exhibit P had been used in causing the injuries to Dalip Singh This appears from the foliowing observations made by them in their judgment The gun P was identified by Jita Singh as the gun with which Mohinder Singh fired at him and Dalip Singh but he identified the gun because of a brass plate at its butt end We have seen the gun Its brass plate could be of no use for the identification of the gun Again commenting on the nature of the injuries the learned Judges observed as follows Another difficulty which is created in this case is the nature of injuries found on the body of Dalip Singh What kind of bullet it was which though it had blackened the area where it entered the brain showing that it had been fired from not far away did not shatter the brain we do not know What kind of projectile it was which entered the body which if the evidence as to be believed was fired at from a few feet at Dalip Singh and passed through the body without shattering the inside of the chest or causing extensive damage therein is also not known Mr Sethi counsel for the accused quoted Taylor s book on medical jurisprudence and Hateher s book on ballistics and argued that the firing must have been from a place between and yards away in order that the projectile may pass through and through the body and not shatter it That of course pre supposes that the barrel of the gun using the word gun m a generic sense is grooved which causes a projectile to go forward with a rotatory motion of something under a quarter of a million revolutions a minute and travelling at the rate of about miles an hour when it leaves the gun We do not know whether the barrel of this gun exhibit P is grooved or not is a single bar relled gun and is country made The likelihood is that the barrel is not grooved On a careful reading of the judgment under appeal it appears that the learned Judges of the High Court strongly felt that they had no adequate explanation in the oral evidence before them for certain puzzling features of the injuries on Dalip Singh This is exactly what we also feel in this case and it seems to us that the evidence which has been adduced falls short of proof in regard to a very mate rial part of the prosecution case in a case where death is due to injuries or wounds caused by a lethal weapon it has always been considered to be the duty of the prosecution to prove by expert evidence that it was likely or at least possible for the injuries to have been caused with the weapon with which and in the manner in which they are al leged to have been caused It is elementary that where the prosecution has a definite or positive case it must prove the whole of that case In the present case it is doubtful whether the injuries which are attributed to the appellant were caused by a gun or by a rifle Indeed it seems more likely that they were caused by a rifle than by a gun and yet the case for the prosecu tion is that the appellant was armed with a gun and in his examination it was definitely put to him that he was armed with the gun P It is only by the evidence of a duly qualified expert that it could have been ascertained whether the injuries attributed to the appellant were caused by a gun or by a rifle and such evidence alone could settle the controversy as to whether they could possibly have been caused by a fire arm being used at such a close range as is suggested in the evidence It is clear and it is also the prosecution case that only shots were fired at Dalip Singh and one of the crucial points which the prosecution had to prove was that these shots were fired by two persons and not by one man and both the shots were fired in such manner and from such distance as is alleged by the eye witnesses There is in our opinion a gap in the prosecu tion evidence on a most fundamental point and the error which has been committed by the courts below is to ignore the gap and decide the case merely upon the oral evidence of witnesses two of whom are mere chance witnesses and not altogether independent persons and the evidence of the third witness is open to criticism on the ground of his partisanship as well as the improbability of his having been able to see the firing at his brother after he had himself been shot at the back of the neck The learned Judges of the High Court after commenting upon the entire evidence say in their judgment We are thus left with the evidence of the three wit nesses of the prosecution together with the state of wounds as shown by the medical evidence and an unsatisfactory statement of Dr Goyle They reject the evidence of Dr Goyle and they consider the nature of the wounds to have created a serious dificulty in the case Having arrived at these conclusions it was a serious thing to rest the appellant s conviction wholly upon the oral testimony in the case which has remained unchecked and unconfirmed by expert evidence The real position ap pears to be that the prosecution case cannot be said to be wholly proved but only partly proved if it is permissible to use such an expression This Court as was pointed out in Pritam Singh vs The State will not entertain a criminal appeal except in special and exceptional cases where it is manifest that by a disregard of the forms of legal process or by a violation of the principles of natural justice or otherwise substantial and grave injustice has been done It seems to us that the present case comes within the rule laid down because the appellant has been convicted notwithstand ing the fact that the evidence is wanting on a mostmaterial part of the prosecution case This is enough to dispose of this appeal but we are constrained to say that we are not altogether happy about the manner in which the plea of alibi put forward by the appellant has been disposed of by the courts below Ordi narily tiffs court will not look beyond the findings of fact arrived at by the courts below but we find that in the present case the decision on the plea of alibi has been arrived at in disregard of the principle that the standard of proof which is required in regard to that plea must be the same as the standard which is applied to the prosecution evidence and in both cases it should be a reasonable stand ard It is common ground in this appeal that the appellant was summoned to appear before the Naib Tehsildar on the th February YEAR which was the date fixed for dealing with Bachittar Singh s complaint Ordinarily and without looking at anything else there should have been nothing improbable about his appearance before the Naib Tehsildar on that date but in the present case there is positive evidence that an application for a taccavi loan bearing that date and also bearing the thumb impression the appellant was put up before the Naib Tehsildar and that was dealt with by him on that very day There is also affirmative evidence of a witness to prove that the appellant was present in the Naib Tehsildar s court This witness is undoubtedly closely related to the appellant but his evidence is supported by probability and a written document One of the points raised by the prosecution was that the summons for appear ance on the th February was not served upon Mohinder Singh but such evidence as there is on the record bearing on this point has certain peculiar features The prosecu tion having cited the Naib Tehsildar and the Ahlmad Bench Clerk as witnesses in the case gave them up and stated that the former had been won over by the appellant This allega tion could have been substantiated in the cross examina tion of the Naib Tehsildar who was examined as a defence witness but nothing was elicited from him to support such a charge From the evidence of the Naib Tehsildar it appears that on the th July YEAR the Public Prosecutor showed him exhibit PS which is an order directing the appearance of the seven persons including the appellant mentioned by Bachittar Singh in his complaint before the Naib Tehsildar on the th February YEAR and that he told the Public Prosecutor that or persons appeared in his court on that date After this incident on the th July YEAR the Public Prosecutor informed the Court that he would give up the Naib Tehsildar as he has been won over The evidence of the process peon is of a somewhat suspicious character because he has conveniently forgotten every material detail The appellant asserted at the trial that the original report of the process peon had been suppressed and another report had been fabricated and substituted in its place An application to this effect was made by him before the committing Magistrate and he also examined a handwriting expert to prove some of his allegations Neither of the courts below has dealt with the evidence of this expert The evidence of the Investigating Officer as recorded by the Sessions Judge is to the following effect PB and PC were obtained by me from the headquar ters Along with PB and PC the Parvana PS was also received by me After going through the zimnis the witness states that the aforesaid documents PB PC and PS were summoned by the committing Magistrate and were not sent for by the witness On th March YEAR a Foot Constable was certainly sent to Zira to bring the said file But since the file had been sent to the headquarters therefore the said constable returned quite blank I never inspected this file at the headquarters The most material document with which we are concerned is PS which should have contained an endorsement of serv ice of summons on the persons against whom Bachittar Singh had complained It is clear from the first part of the evidence of the Investigating Officer that he had received the report of the process peon which was endorsed on the back of PS from the headquarters but he says later that the papers were sent for but they did not arrive It is surprising that when a document was the subject of so much controversy he should have said by mistake that he had received it One of the comments made by the learned Ses sions Judge in dealing with the application alleged to have been made by the appellant on the th February YEAR for a taccavi loan is that after producing the application before the Naib Tehsildar on that date Mohinder Singh could have reached his village by noon time but on this point the learned Sessions Judge seems to have wholly ignored the evidence of the Naib Tehsildar that he usually dealt with such applications between and PM on working days and also the affirmative evidence of Joginder Singh In our opinion there has been in substance no fair and proper trial in this case and we are constrained to allow this appeal set aside the conviction of the appellant under sections and read with section S of the Indian Penal Code and direct that he be set at liberty forthwith In ordinary circumstances we might have remanded the case for a flesh trial but we consider that such a course would in the present case be unfair and contrary to settled practice seeing that the appellant has been in a state of suspense over his sentence of death for more than a year Appeal allowed\n"

    "October 17.\n",
    "The judgment of the court was deliv ered by FAZL ALI J.\n",
    "This is an appeal by special leave from the judgment of the High Court of Punjab upholding the convic tion of the appellant.\n",
    "Mohinder Singh, under sections 302 and 307 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and confirming the sentence of death passed against him by the Sessions Judge of Ferozepore.\n",
    "The case for the prosecution which has been substantial ly accepted by the trial Judge and the High Court is briefly as follows.\n",
    "Sometime in January, 1949, one Bachittar Singh, brother of Dalip Singh who is said, to have been murdered, lodged a complaint before the NaibTehsildar at Zira to the effect that a tree belonging to him had been cut by 7 per sons including Mohinder Singh, the appellant.\n",
    "On the 28th February, 1949, which was the date fixed for the hearing of the case before the Naib TehsiIdar, Jita Singh and Dalip Singh, the two brothers of Bachittar Singh, were attacked by the appellant and one Gurnam Singh, a lad of 17, near a Gurdwara at about mid day, when 823 they were returning from their field.\n",
    "Jita Singh was then carrying a load of fodder on his head while Dalip Singh had sickles in his hand.\n",
    "Jita Singh was the first to be at tacked near a tailor 's shop by Mohinder Singh who fired at him from behind hitting him on the neck whereupon he fell down together with the bundle of fodder.\n",
    "Dalip Singh, who was following Jita Singh, then ran backwards and he was chased by Gurnam Singh round the outer boundary of a tank which was close by.\n",
    "Mohinder Singh ran on the other side of the tank in the opposite direction and confronted him and shot him with a gun on the chest whereupon he fell down.\n",
    "Meanwhile, Gurnam Singh had also reached the spot and he fired with his rifle from a distance of about 4 or 5 feet near about Dalip Singh 's ear while he was lying sideways.\n",
    "The injuries proved fatal and Dalip Singh died on the spot.\n",
    "The same day at 3 p.m., Jita Singh went to the police station at Dharamkot, which is at a distance of 3 miles from village Augar, where the occurrence had taken place, and lodged a first information report, charging Mohinder Singh, with having caused injury to him, and Mohinder Singh and Gurnam Singh with the murder of Dalip Singh; and the police after investigating the case sent up a charge sheet against the two accused persons.\n",
    "Thereafter they were tried by the Sessions Judge of Ferozepore under sections 302 and 307 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.\n",
    "The appellant was sentenced to death under section 302 and Gurnam Singh was sentenced to transportation for life under that section in view of his youth.\n",
    "They were also sentenced to 3 years ' rigorous imprisonment each under section 307 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.\n",
    "It appears that Dalip Singh had 6 injuries altogether which are described by the doctor who performed the post mortem on his body in these words: \" 1.\n",
    "An irregularly round gun shot wound on the left temporal region, 1\" diameter.\n",
    "The wound is 22\" behind outer canthus of left eye, its upper portion is at a level with the top of the pinna of the left ear, 824 behind it commences at the cartilages of the ear which are broken.\n",
    "Brain is visible in the gap of the wound.\n",
    "An area 4 \" x 4 \" is blackened, the wound being situated in the middle of this area.\n",
    "A gun shot wound 3/4\" X 1/2\" on the back of right mastoid region, upper end of the wound is 1\" behind the root of the right ear.\n",
    "Direction is vertically oblique.\n",
    "On dissection the left temporal bone under injury No. 1 is, hole and its petrous portion shattered.\n",
    "A linear fracture extends upwards and backwards, from the hole into the left parietal and occipital bones.\n",
    "After piercing through the left temporal lobe of the brain the projectile has pierced through the brainstem, and emerged out as injury No. 2, holding the mastoid region of the skull on the right side.\n",
    "A gun shot wound 3/4\" X 5/8\" on the left side of chest 21/2\" above and behind the left nipple and 1/2\" behind the anterior axillary fold as area 1\" below the wound is bruised.\n",
    "A gun shot wound 1/2\"X 3/4\" on the right side of chest in the mid axillary line.\n",
    "The top of the wound being 1 3/4\" from the apex of right axilla and 4 3/4\" above and behind the right nipple.\n",
    "A gun shot wound 1/2\"x 1/4\" on the inner aspect of the right arm, upper end of the wound is 11/4\" from the top of the anterior axillary fold.\n",
    "A gun shot wound 3/4\"X 1/2\" on the front of the right arm.\n",
    "Its upper end being 21/2\" from the top of the anterior axillary fold.\n",
    "Its distance from injury No. 5 being 1\" and it is inter connected with injury No. 5 under the skin.\n",
    "\" The doctor has stated in his evidence that in all two projectiles appeared to have hit Dalip Singh, and injuries Nos. 1 and 2 were caused by one of them, injury No. 1 being the wound of entrance and injury No. 2 being the wound of exit, With regard to the other 4 injuries, his evidence is as follows : \"Injury No. 3 is the wound of entrance of another projectile and No. 4 is the wound of its exit.\n",
    "Wound 825 No. 5 is the wound of its re entrance and wound No. 6 the wound of its final exit from the body.\" Jita Singh had 4 slight injuries on the back of the neck which are said to have been caused by pellets and two abra sions below the right elbow and right knee said to have been caused by blunt weapons.\n",
    "It may be stated here that when the investigating police officer arrived at the scene of occurrence, he found an empty cartridge case at the place where Jita Singh is said to have been fired at, and 2 empty cartridge cases and a blood stained cap of a cartridge case near the place where the dead body of Dalip Singh was lying.\n",
    "Later, when Mohinder Singh appeared before the police, he was asked whether he possessed a gun and he produced a 12 bore gun (exhibit P 16) for which he held a licence.\n",
    "The gun and the empty cartridges were thereupon sent to Dr. Goyle, Director of the C.I.D. Laboratory, Phillaur, and the opinion that he submitted may be summed up as follows : The gun had signs of having been fired but he could not say when it was fired last.\n",
    "The cartridge cases P 10 and P 15 could have been fired through the gun P 16, but he could not say wheth er they were actually fired from that particular gun or a similar gun or guns.\n",
    "He did not make any experiment by firing any cartridge from the gun P 16, nor did he compare the markings on the empty cartridges P 10 and P 15.\n",
    "A notable feature of the case is that the occurrence is said to have taken place in the vicinity of a Gurdwara and some houses, but in spite of this fact, not a single person of the locality has been cited or examined as a witness by the prosecution.\n",
    "The whole case rests on the evidence of 3 witnesses, viz., Jita Singh, Harnam Singh and Buta Singh.\n",
    "Jita Singh, who had been shot at from behind, claims to have seen the two accused firing at his brother.\n",
    "Harnam Singh admittedly lives at a considerable distance from the place of occurrence but has stated that he was coming from another village where he had gone to fetch some medicine for his maternal cousin, when he 826 saw the occurrence.\n",
    "Buta Singh, who is a tonga driver, belongs to a distant village and is somewhat remotely related to Harnam Singh, and accounts for his presence near the scene of occurrence by saying that he had come to see Harnarn Singh the evening before.\n",
    "Harnam Singh admitted in his evidence that there was a dispute between him and Mohinder Singh nearly a month before the occurrence about a wall, but he also says that the dispute ' had been amicably settled by the panchayat\".\n",
    "There is nothing before us to show what the award of the panchayat was and whether or not it left any ill feeling behind.\n",
    "But, on the argu ments of the counsel and the apparently trivial motive for which Dalip Singh is said to have been murdered, it would appear that among the class of persons with which we are concerned petty quarrels give rise to enmity which does not die soon or easily.\n",
    "After the close of prosecution evidence in the Ses sions Court, the appellant was examined under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and he denied that he had fired at Jita Singh and Dalip Singh with the gun P 16 and that Gurnam Singh had fired at Dalip Singh with a rifle.\n",
    "He added that he was not present in village Augur at the time of the alleged occurrence but had gone to Zira to attend the Naib Tehsildar 's court.\n",
    "To establish his plea of alibi, he examined 3 witnesses in the court of the Sessions Judge.\n",
    "The first witness was the Naib Tehsildar before whom Bachittar Singh had lodged the complaint, and he stated that when the case was called on the 28th February, 1949, 6 or 7 persons appeared in court.\n",
    "He also proved an application for a taccavi loan which purports to have been filed by the appel lant on the 28th February, 1949, and bears his thumb impres sion.\n",
    "He further stated in his evidence that he had passed orders on that application on the 28th February but he did not know Mohinder Singh and therefore could not say who had produced that application before him on that date.\n",
    "The second witness for the appellant was his brother in law, Jogindar Singh, who had written the application.\n",
    "exhibit D C.\n",
    "He has stated that 827 Mohinder Singh himself was present in the court of the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949, that he had signed the application (exhibit D C) and that he was also one of the persons who had appeared before the Tehsildar when Bachittar Singh 's case was called out.\n",
    "The third defence witness is a hand writing and fingerprint expert.\n",
    "He has proved that the application (exhibit D C) alleged to have been presented to the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February bore the thumb impression of the appellant, and he has also given evidence to show that certain handwritings which he was asked to compare did not tally.\n",
    "The evidence given by him with regard to these handwritings has a bearing on the assertion made by the appellant in a petition filed before the committing Magistrate to the effect that the original service report of the process peon showing that the appellant also was one of the persons served for appearance before the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949, had been suppressed and another report with forged handwriting had been substituted in its place.\n",
    "Both the courts below have held that the alibi has not been proved by satisfactory evidence and that the charges against the appellant have been made 'out.\n",
    "It seems that the learned Judges of the High Court were not at all impressed by the evidence of Dr. Goyle which they characterized as unsatisfactory and they were not also confident that the gun, exhibit P 16, had been used in causing the injuries to Dalip Singh.\n",
    "This appears from the folio.wing observations made by them in their judgment: \"The gun P 16 was identified by Jita Singh as the gun with which Mohinder Singh fired at him and Dalip Singh but he identified the gun because of a brass plate at its butt end.\n",
    "We have seen the gun.\n",
    "Its brass plate could be of no use for the identification of the gun.\n",
    "\" Again, commenting on the nature of the injuries, the learned Judges observed as follows : 828 \"Another difficulty which is created in this case is the nature of injuries found on the body of Dalip Singh .\n",
    "What kind of bullet it was which, though it had blackened the area where it entered the brain showing that it had been fired from not far away, did not shatter the brain we do not know.\n",
    "What kind of projectile it was which entered the body (which if the evidence as to be believed was fired at from a few feet at Dalip Singh) and passed through the body without shattering the inside of the chest or causing extensive damage therein is also not known.\n",
    "Mr. Sethi (counsel for the accused) quoted Taylor 's book on medical jurisprudence and Hateher 's book on ballistics and argued that the firing must have been from a place between 600 and 1,200 yards away in order that the projectile may pass through and through the body and not shatter it.\n",
    "That of course pre supposes that the barrel of the gun, using the word 'gun ' m ' a generic sense, is grooved which causes a projectile to go forward with a rotatory motion of something under a quarter of a million revolutions a minute and travelling at the rate of about 2,000 miles an hour when it leaves the gun . .\n",
    "We do not know whether the barrel of this gun (exhibit P 16) is grooved or not.\n",
    "is a single bar relled gun and is country made.\n",
    "The likelihood is that the barrel is not grooved.\n",
    "\" On a careful reading of the judgment under appeal, it appears that the learned Judges of the High Court strongly felt that they had no adequate explanation in the oral evidence before them for certain puzzling features of the injuries on Dalip Singh.\n",
    "This is exactly what we also feel in this case, and it seems to us that the evidence which has been adduced falls short of proof in regard to a very mate rial part of the prosecution case.\n",
    "in a case where death is due to injuries or wounds caused by a lethal weapon, it has always been considered to be the duty of the prosecution to prove by expert evidence that it was likely or at least possible for the injuries to have been caused with the weapon with which and in the manner in which they are al leged to have been caused.\n",

    "It is clear, and it is also the prosecution case, that only 2 shots were fired at Dalip Singh and one of the crucial points which the prosecution had to prove was that these shots were fired by two persons and not by one man, and both the shots were fired in such manner and from such distance as is alleged by the eye witnesses.\n",

    "It is common ground in this appeal that the appellant was summoned to appear before the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949, which was the date fixed for dealing with Bachittar Singh 's complaint.\n",

    "One of the points raised by the prosecution was that the summons for appear ance on the 28th February was not served upon Mohinder Singh, but such evidence as there is on the record bearing on this point has certain peculiar features.\n",
    "The prosecu tion having cited the Naib Tehsildar and the Ahlmad (Bench Clerk) as witnesses in the case gave them up and stated that the former had been won over by the appellant.\n",
    "This allega tion could have been substantiated in the cross examina tion of the Naib Tehsildar who was examined as a defence witness, but nothing was elicited from him to support such a charge.\n",
    "From the evidence of the Naib Tehsildar, it appears that on the 5th July, 1949, the Public Prosecutor showed him exhibit P.S. (which is an order directing the appearance of the seven persons including the appellant mentioned by Bachittar Singh in his complaint, before the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949).\n",
    "and that he told the Public Prosecutor that 6 or 7 persons appeared in his court.\n",
    "on that date.\n",
    "After this incident, on the 6th July, 1949, the Public Prosecutor informed the Court that he would \"give up the Naib Tehsildar as he has been won over \".\n",
    "The evidence of the process peon is of a somewhat suspicious character, because he has conveniently forgotten every material detail.\n",
    "The appellant asserted at the trial that the original report of the process peon had been suppressed and another report had been fabricated and substituted in its place.\n",
    "An application to this effect was made by him before the committing Magistrate, and he also examined a handwriting expert to prove some of his allegations.\n",
    "Neither of the courts below has dealt with the evidence 832 of this expert.\n",
    "The evidence of the Investigating Officer as recorded by the Sessions Judge is to the following effect : \"P.B. and P.C. were obtained by me from the headquar ters.\n",
    "Along with P.B. and P.C. the Parvana P.S. was also received by me.\n",
    "After going through the zimnis, the witness states that the aforesaid documents P.B., P.C. and P.S. were summoned by the committing Magistrate and were not sent for by the witness.\n",
    "On 16th March, 1949, a Foot Constable was certainly sent to Zira to bring the said file.\n",
    "But since the file had been sent to the headquarters, therefore, the said constable returned quite blank.\n",
    "I never inspected this file at the headquarters.\n",
    "\" The most material document with which we are concerned is P.S. which should have contained an endorsement of serv ice of summons on the persons against whom Bachittar Singh had complained.\n",
    "It is clear from the first part of the evidence of the Investigating Officer that he had received the report of the process peon which was endorsed on the back of P.S., from the headquarters, but he says later that the papers were sent for but they did not arrive.\n",
    "It is surprising that when a document was the subject of so much controversy he should have said by mistake that he had received it.\n",
    "One of the comments made by the learned Ses sions Judge in dealing with the application alleged to have been made by the appellant on the 28th February, 1949, for a taccavi loan is that after producing the application before the Naib Tehsildar on that date, Mohinder Singh could have reached his village by noon time, but on this point the learned Sessions Judge seems to have wholly ignored the evidence of the Naib Tehsildar that he usually dealt with such applications between 12 and 4 P.M. on working days, and also the affirmative evidence of Joginder Singh.\n",
    "In our opinion, there has been in substance no fair and proper trial in this case, and we are constrained to allow this appeal, set aside the conviction of the appellant under sections 302 and 307 read with section S4 833 of the Indian Penal Code, and direct that he be set at liberty forthwith.\n",
    "In ordinary circumstances, we might have remanded the case for a flesh trial, but we consider that such a course would, in the present case, be unfair and contrary to settled practice, seeing that the appellant has been in a state of suspense over his sentence of death for more than a year.\n",
    "Appeal allowed.\n",
